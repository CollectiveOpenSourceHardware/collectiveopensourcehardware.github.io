| Tools         | Heat gun , Magnifying glass, Soldering gun             |
| Needed skills | Operation of reflow oven                    |
| Time          | 2 mins for each irregular components                                   |
| Result        | Tested OK                                   | 

## Caution :
use handgloves during the time of usage.
# 6.1 Identifying the Irregularities:
In the picture shown below the identified displaced components will lead to component malfunction and short-circuits. The magnifing lens is used 
thorougly to check others parts on the board for irregularities.

## 6.2 Removing the Irregularities with Heat gun:
Using the Heat gun, the soldering is removed on the applied area. Also , soldering wick can be used to de-solder the joints.

## 6.3 Soldering with Rosin core and soldering wick:
Now the components are placed correctly and soldered with the help of rosin core also Soldering wick can be used to avoid contacts between successive pins.

Now it goes to the next stage of commisioning and testing, where thorough check is done on electrical contacts and short circuits.
