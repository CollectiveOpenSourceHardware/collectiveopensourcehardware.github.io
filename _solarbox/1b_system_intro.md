Since prehistory, when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food, through the Middle Ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat, until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom. Man has sought endlessly for energy sources.

The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist Michael Faraday. His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or disc of copper between the poles of a magnet. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of alternating current (AC) power transmission, using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.
In 1870, commercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. In 1870, the mechanical production of electric power began the Second Industrial Revolution and created inventions using the energy.

### Chemical Energy (I)

Chemical energy is the energy which helps to "glue" atoms together in those clusters called molecules, or chemical compounds. Of special interest to us are substances such as natural gas, or propane, or oil that are capable of releasing some of that energy. When we burn these fuels, we unglue some of the atoms from each other, liberating the chemically-bound energy that held them together. In the process, the chemical energy is changed in form to high temperature heat energy, a form well suited to doing many different kinds of work. This process takes place every time we flick butane lighter. [5]

### Thermal Energy (II)

Thermal energy involves the microscopic movement of atoms and molecules in everything around us. Thermal energy is often commonly referred to as heat. In fact, there are really two types of thermal energy. 

-	"Sensible" Energy or sensible heat, is energy that jostles molecules and atoms in substances such as water. The more movement, the hotter the substance becomes. Sensible energy gets its name from the fact that we can sense it, by touching the substance directly or indirectly with a thermometer of some type. When we add heat to water in a kettle, we increase its temperature.

-	"Latent" Energy or latent heat, is the energy that is needed to make a substance such as water (a liquid) change to a different form (or phase) of the same substance such as water vapour (a gas). The change of form happens when enough sensible heat is added, and the molecules move too fast to be connected together and eventually separate. It gets its name from the fact that it lies hidden or latent, until the conditions are suitable for it to emerge.

If enough heat is added to liquid water 100 Â°C, it eventually boils and becomes a vapour, also called a gas. If enough heat is removed from liquid water at 0oC, it eventually turns into the solid we call ice. Heat will always naturally flow from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. Thermal energy may move in many different ways, between many different substances, and change back and forth between its sensible and latent forms. Throughout this guide, much of the discussion is concerned with understanding and managing every form of energy, its movement and transformations. [5]

### Mechanical Energy (III)
Mechanical energy is the energy of physical movement, such as moving air or water, a ball being thrown, or even a person sanding a piece of wood. As with many forms of energy, mechanical energy eventually ends up being released or lost as thermal energy. A good example of this is the way that the sandpaper and wood convert mechanical energy to sensible energy that you feel as heat. [5]

### Electrical Energy (IV)
Electrical energy involves the movement of electric current through wires. Electrical energy is a very useful form of energy because it can perform many functions. Ultimately, most electrical energy or electricity also ends up as thermal energy in the form of sensible heat. Some devices such as electric heaters convert the energy directly; other devices such as motors convert electricity to mechanical energy which eventually becomes heat. The trick to optimizing electricity use is to maximize the amount of work done by electricity before it is lost as heat. Typically, this also involves optimizing the use of mechanical energy. [5]

## Methods of generating electricity
Several fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. Utility-scale generation is done by rotating electric generators, or by photovoltaic systems. A very small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries. [5]

## Energy Systems
Energy can not be created or destroyed; in other to have electrical energy a converting from another form of energy is necessary.  Most power in the world is generated by converting hot steam into movement, which can be made into electricity.

The traditional electricity value chain has been considered to consist of five links: fuel/energy source, generation, transmission, distribution and customer-side energy service as shown in Figure 1. [2]

### Generation

There are a lot of energy power generation, that can be described. 

- Chemical reactions: Fuel Cells - takes oxygen and hydrogen (H2) and makes electricity.  It can also use diesel oil instead of H2 (PEM fuel cell).

- Thermoelectric - extract energy by converting heat energy into electrical energy.

- Piezoelectric effect - extracts energy from crystals/molecules, useful only for tiny amounts of power.[3]

- Water Power: Hydro power - using falling and moving water to produce motion which turns a generator. Tidal Stream Generator - using movement of tides to turn a turbine (like an underwater wind turbine). Ocean thermal energy conversion - OTEC uses a turbine driven by water moving between cold deep water and warmer water above. [3]

- Combustion (coal, oil, gas, wood): Steam Turbine - channels hot steam through a turbine to create motion. Reciprocating Steam Engines - uses steam pressure through a piston. [3]

- Internal Combustion Engines: Gas Turbine - burns natural gas or other fuels.

- Diesel Engine - typically used to power locomotives (diesel electric) or back-up generators. Gasoline Engines - typically used in small scale generators (home generators) and powers automobile power systems. [3]

- Nuclear: Nuclear Fission used to power a Steam Turbine. Cold Fusion - a way to create massive amounts of heat in a compact device. Hydrogen ions are sucked into a lattice of nickel, and through atomic processes is converted to copper. This makes a lot of heat and can be used to make steam. [3]

- Solar Power: Photovoltaic (PV)- direct current electricity from semiconductor materials exposed to the sun. [3]

- Solar Thermal: Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) - using mirrors to focus the sun on a liquid which is turned to steam and drives a steam turbine. [3] 

- Wind power: Mechanical engineers working on windmills must deal with a long list of challenges.  Transmissions used to control the speed of the rotating shaft are quite a challenge as high winds can break connections. [3]

- Earth: Geothermal - heat from the earth (typically volcanic zones) produces steam which can turn turbines or hot water heats another liquid with lower evaporation point which can turn a steam turbine. [3]

### Transmission and distribution

The ability to maintain all system components on a transmission line in synchronous operation with each other to prevent collapse of a system. Voltage regulation: Stable voltage between each end of all power lines can be maintained through voltage regulation.  Asset deferral: This refers to deferring of the need for additional transmission facilities by supplementing the existing transmission facilities to save capital that otherwise goes underutilised for years. [2]

### Energy Service

Energy Management allows customers to peak shave by shifting energy demand from one time of the day to another thus reducing their time-of-use (demand) charges. 

Power quality provides electrical service to customers without any secondary oscillations or disruptions to the electricity "waveform" such as swells/sags, spikes, or harmonics. Power Reliability provides bridging power (UPS) for consumers to 'ride-through' a power disruption. Coupled with energy management storage, this allows remote power operation.

## Renewable energy

Future development of renewable energy technologies will drive the cost down. This has already been evidenced in wind and photovoltaic power generation. Nonetheless, the widespread deployment of solar, wind and wave power in the future will face the fundamental difficulty of intermittent supplies, which requires demand flexibility, backup power sources, and enough electricity storage for hours to days and perhaps a week. where single-function applications were identified.


### Photovoltaics

Photovoltaics has a long history. It began in 1839 with observations carried out by Edmond Becquerel - the son of Antoine Cesar Becquerel and father of Henry Becquerel, both well-known physicists. Becquerel observed that if two platinum electrodes are placed in solution and exposed to sunlight, electric current flows. This effect was very small and had no practical significance at that time, yet it remained unforgotten. Moreover, this effect was not understood until Einstein delivered the explanation of the photoelectric effect and quantum nature of light in his well-known paper from 1904. But even then this effect remained for a long time an interesting physical phenomenon but without practical meaning. A working solar cell was only realised after semiconductor technology had evolved. In particular, the availability of high-purity crystalised silicon was an important prerequisite. Even today silicon remains by far the most important material for solar cell production. The first silicon solar cell was created in 1954 in the Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, United States, by the scientists Chapin, Fuller and Pearson. Even back then solar cells were able to achieve an efficiency of 6 per cent, which was soon increased to 10 per cent. [1]
