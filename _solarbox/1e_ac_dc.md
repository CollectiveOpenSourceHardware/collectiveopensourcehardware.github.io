At constant or DC current, the current between two poles flows always in the same direction. The **technical** current flow moves from the higher potential point to the lower potential point. In case of AC current, the direction of current flow varies in time. For example in a 50 Hz network, the direction fifty times in one and fifty times in the opposite direction in a second.

The AC current is mostly used for transport electricity to consumers and for example AC motors or some other larger electrical machines. All the electronic devices that is used today they are using DC current, e.g. laptops and mobile phones.
