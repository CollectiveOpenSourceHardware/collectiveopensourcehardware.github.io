Once the solder paste is applied to the PCB based, We now proceed with placing the electronic components.

## Reading the PCB layout
Since there is a long list of components to be placed, It is easier to organize them in orderly fashion, for ex: starting with resistors of one class and then the next by referring the Items list as show below.

## Placing the components
The electronic components are picked up with the help of tweezers and are placed on the PCB layout, for precision a magnifier lens can be used. Look carefully for the orientation of the components.

## Inspection before proceeding to re-flow oven:
Once the step is completed, we do an inspection to see the pins are seated on the respective markings.
