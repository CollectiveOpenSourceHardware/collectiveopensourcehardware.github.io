## Universities

![Hoou](/images/hoou_logo_small.png)

By collaboration with universities and research institutes, we would like to promote the ideas of Open Hardware and Circular Economy also in scientific contexts.

The Open Education Ressource (OER) of the Libre Solar Box Reproduction was supported and funded by the [Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU)](https://www.hoou.de/).

One goal is to integrate the developed system components also into seminars practical projects at different universities.

## Fab Labs

The Libre Solar Box was built in the [Fab Lab St. Pauli](http://fablab-hamburg.org/) (Hamburg, Germany).

## Open Hardware Projects

![libre_solar](/images/libresolar_logo_small.png)

The [Libre Solar](http://libre.solar/) project provides the needed elctrical parts for building up a the decentralized energy supply.
With this project we want to show the possibilities of open hardware by reproducing the PCB and developing a system around the electrical parts.

## Community
