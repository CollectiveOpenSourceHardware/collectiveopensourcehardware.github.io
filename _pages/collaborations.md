## Universities

By collaboration with universities and research institutes, we would like to promote the ideas of Open Hardware and Circular Economy also in scientific contexts.

The Open Education Ressource (OER) of the Libre Solar Box Reproduction was supported and funded by the Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU).

One future goal is to integrate the developed system components also into seminars at different universities.

## Fab Labs

The Libre Solar Box was built in the Fab Lab St. Pauli (Hamburg, Germany).
