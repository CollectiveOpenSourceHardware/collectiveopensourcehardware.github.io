An electrical board consists of two basic modules
- circuit board
- electrical components

These two components must be combined together to get a working board.
This combination process is shown in the steps.

The production of the printed circuit board is not part of this step-by-step guide. It is obtained externally from a manufacturer. How to order a blank PCB is explained under [Ordering Process](/solarbox/pcb_order).

The following figure shows an overview of each required step.
