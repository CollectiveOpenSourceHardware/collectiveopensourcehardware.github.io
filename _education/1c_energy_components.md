To work with Energy is a complex process as it is possible to convert it into different forms, transport it, store it in forms of chemical energy and use it in various form of end use requirement. Every Energy generation system in the world has main component
1. Source to generate energy/electricity
2. Load : Device that consume the energy like TV, Radio, Fridge
3. Transmission line which can transfer the energy from sources to loads for example wiring
4. Storage to store the energy for later use when it's needed like Li-I battery storage.  

The Stand-alone system is define as shown in below figure.

## Energy Source

Source is the origin of energy that can be generate energy by using the Wind, Sun, water and/or from chemical energy stored in Biogas, oil, etc. The major factor that effects on the generation of energy is the efficiency of the Source and cost of investment. The size and the energy generation are depending upon the availability of the resources like Wind & Sun, requirement of the user. In this project, solar PV Panel are used for energy generation sources. This solar panel is made of monocrystalline solar cell. Source can be also the wind turbine as well.

## Load

Load is the device or electrical component or portion of circuit that can consume energy. Load should be house hold appliances like bulb, TV, radio, fridge, washing machine or coffee machine. Load is the describe with how much energy they consume in watts. There are different types of loads are connected within the circuit like Resistive loads, Capacitive loads, Inductive loads or combined loads.

## Transmission

Transmission of energy is the why to transfer energy from origin to the consumed device. It should be the wire for electricity or any other electricity conductive material. Transmission can be divided in to different types centralized or decentralized; AC or DC; High, Medium or low voltage; long or short distance transmission system. Efficiency of transmission put key role on losses of energy during transfer. So, for low demand & short distance transmission we should use DC transmission system else for long distance and large amount of power source transfer we should use AC transmission system, because in DC power transmission losses will be exponentially increase with increase in distance. We can say that transmission system is the backbone for energy system. For stand-alone system electrical wirings are the transmission system and it can be AC wiring or DC wiring. All the controllers and the metering devices considered in to the transmission system like charge controller and Switching system.  

## Storage

Storage is the technique to store additional energy generated by sources for specific time and when energy require then we can reuse this energy from storage system. Energy storage can be battery storage as a chemical energy, Gas storage as a different state of energy. According to technology we can store the energy for long term or short term. In stand-alone system, generally used LiFePO4 battery as a storage system, because this type of storage is simple in technology, cheaper then other techniques and we can save in smaller form as requirement.
