In the following pages you will learn how to reproduce a printed circuit board, short a PCB.
As a showcase we use a solarcharger circuit that in the end together with solarpanels and batteries you have a ready-to-use regenerative energy system.

## What is a Printed Circuit Board (PCB)?
As the word PCB is used so often in this OER we want to explain what a PCB is.
A printed circuit board (PCB) is a carrier for electronic components. It serves for mechanical fastening and electrical connection. Almost every electronic device contains one or more printed circuit boards.
Together with electric parts you get a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA). Usually you just use the term PCB. But to differentiate between a PCB with and without electric parts you have the extra term PCBA.

Further information you find in following [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)

The two components of PCB and electric parts must be combined together to get a working board.
This combination process is shown in the following steps.
The production of the PCB without the electrical parts is not part of this step-by-step guide. It is obtained externally from a manufacturer. How to order a blank PCB is explained under [Ordering Process](/education/reproduction_pcb_order/).

## What do you get at the end of this reproduction guide?
The result of this reproduction guide is MPPT solarcharger, a PCB for running a electrical solar power system.
In the upcoming OER you will learn how to connect the solarcharger with solarpanels and batteries together.

## Roadmap

1. First we tell you what knowledge is neccessary in order to complete the OER.

2. After this you get a little introduction in the tools and environment where you find all the needed data

3. Then you can start with the steps you see in the navigation in the left side. The first step - the ordering process you can do at home. The further steps you have to have the needed machines and tools so we recommend you to visit your favourite fablab to do so.
