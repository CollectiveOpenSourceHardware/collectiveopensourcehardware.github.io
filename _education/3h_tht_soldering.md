**Caution:** use handgloves during the time of usage.

Here you see the PCB with and without THT (**T**hrough **H**ole **T**echnique) parts.

## Identifying the Irregularities
In the picture shown below the identified displaced components will lead to component malfunction and short-circuits. The magnifying lens is used to thoroughly check other parts on the board for irregularities.

## Removing the Irregularities with Heat gun
Using the Heat gun, the soldering is removed on the applied area. Also , soldering wick can be used to de-solder the joints.

## Soldering with rosin core and soldering wick
Now that the components are placed correctly and soldered with the help of rosin core also Soldering wick can be used to avoid contacts between successive pins.

Now it goes to the next stage of commissioning and testing, where thorough check is done on electrical contacts and short circuits.
