The following pages will describe the build-up of an open source solar box based on Libre Solar components. As an Open Education Resource (OER), it is aimed to be accessible to as many people as possible.

The first chapters will describe **energy systems** in general. Afterwards, the **Libre Solar ecosystem** will be explained in more detail, followed by a detailed **step-by-step guide** how to reproduce PCBs using the Libre Solar boards as an example.
