Centralized system is the traditional power generation system that transfer high amount of power in MW/GW from Thermal or Nuclear power station to the consumer that located far away from the generation plant. So, Power is generated at one place and distributed in different places by overhead power transmission line.

Decentralized system is the system where sources are located near to the load and generation sources produce small amount of power in kW/MW. Decentralize sources like Photovoltaics PV panels, Wind turbines are commonly used now a day.

The criteria for comparisons of Centralized vs Decentralized system presented as mentioned below and it involve the economies of scale study and consider the most cost-effective system, [3]

I)	Economies of scale: the advent of centralized system like steam turbines made it possible to increase the size of the turbines while decreasing the marginal cost of electricity production. Decentralized system is more expensive and required higher cost for maintenance for maintenance.

II)	Energy efficiency: Centralized system gains in efficiency were achieved through larger facilities that are capable of withstanding higher stem pressures and temperatures used in electricity generation. In Centralized system power generation system is more efficient then decentralized power generation system.

III)	Innovation in electricity transmission: the use of alternate current as opposed to or direct current is permitted to transmit electricity over long distances without a significant loss or reduction, but for decentralized system we can use DC transmission to easily transmit power in short range.  

IV)	Reliability: to increase the reliability at the customer's end, large electricity production facilities were connected to the transmission networks, but damage in the main transmission line it can occurs power outage. While in decentralized system user get the power from various generation sources, so power outage problem is negligible in decentralized system.

V)	Environmental constraints: the use of transmission networks made it possible to relocate the generation facilities outside the city canters thus removing pollution due to exhaust from coal fire plants. Other criteria for the comparison of Centralized/Decentralized is to evaluate the resiliency of the combined infrastructure, the impact on sustainability due to Centralized/Decentralized or both as it relates to diminishing radiation, decreasing emissions, and reducing environmental effects. Another criterion for the Centralized/Decentralized comparison is to evaluate the resiliency and sustainability of the combined infrastructure and determine the most effective combination of Centralized/Decentralized aimed at meeting the needs of the future electric grid. In decentralized system mostly, renewable power generation sources are used and it censored more environmental friendly then tradition power generation by centralized system.

VI)	Safety : For safety concern centralized system is less safer then decentralized system. While centralized system has higher power generation equipment at power plant then decentralized system. Also, the transmission lines are high voltage power supply with open overhead lines which can occurs dangerous accident.
