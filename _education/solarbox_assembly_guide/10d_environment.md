Before you can start with the assembly you need to prepare some tools and materials.
For the assembly we recommend your local fablab and a group of people to do it togehter instead of yourself :)

## Prepare tools and place
  - table
  - crimping tool
  - screwdriver
  - side cutter
  - allen wrench

## Prepare material and components
  - Frame and Housing: based on the Open Hardware project [UniProKit (UPK)](https://wiki.opensourceecology.de/Universal_Prototyping_Kit)
    - screws, nuts
    - T-slot alu profile
    - 3D printed corner elements / connectors
    - bottom plate
    - housing plates

You can find the complete [BOM (bill of materials) for the boxframe](https://wiki.opensourceecology.de/BOM_BoxSet_V.2_mobile) at the project webpage of the UniProKit.

  - Battery pack
    - 3D printed battery case: bottom and cap -> [download link](https://github.com/CollectiveOpenSourceHardware/LibreSolarBox/tree/master/Solar%20Box_FreeCAD%20Design/Battery_Case_Holder_FreeCAD_Design)
    - battery cells
    - cell connectors
  - electrical components
    - Libre Solar components -> MPPT, *BMS*, (optional: CAN2Wifi)
    - (optional: RaspberryPi0)
    - wires - power wires (6 sq mm), balancing wires (2 sq mm)
    - ferrules, cable lugs
    - (optional: communication wire - ethernet cable)
   - plugs and switch
     - dc-output plugs (car plug, 2x)
     - solar input plugs (Weidm√ºller PV Stick allows assembly w/o crimping and is compatible to MC4. Clips should be removed that the plug can be unmounted without tools)
     - ON/OFF switch, pushbutton, integrated LED
     - (optional: usb plugs: if 5V USB output is needed. This can also be achieved with a USB adapter for car plugs)
     - (optional: RJ45 jacks (2x))
     - (optional: epaper display+conncetion wire)
