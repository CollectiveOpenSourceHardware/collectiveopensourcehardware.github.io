Wiring the battery cells needs extra caution.

### Add batteries
* Mark the batteries with numbers *1*, *2*, *3*, and *4*.
* Put batteries into the battery case.
* Isolate main **+** and main **-** of the batteries. (Is it important to have main "+" or "-" on particular side of the battery block?")
Now carrefully connect batteries one by one, from *4* to *1*.
* Put connector between *4* and *3*.
* Put a washer on the connector on the side *4*.
* Put thin cable with tag *4* on the washer
* Put another washer on the connector of the thin cable. (Too many washers, check it again).
* Put a bolt throw connector, washers and thin cable and  tighten it. (bots or screws?).
* Put a washer on connector on side *3*.
* Put a bolt throw the washer and the connector and tighten it.
* Connect in the simmilar way batteries *3* with *2* and *2* with *1*.
* Do **not** remove isolation from main **+** and main **-** yet.
