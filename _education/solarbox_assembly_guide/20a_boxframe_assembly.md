The assemby guide for the proposed boxframe can be seen in our [github repository](https://github.com/CollectiveOpenSourceHardware/LibreSolarBox/blob/master/boxframe/buildinstructional/box-assemblyguide/boxassemblyguide1d.pdf)

We will adapt the layout to this webpage step by step.
But like we said at the beginning: this boxframe is just a proposal.
