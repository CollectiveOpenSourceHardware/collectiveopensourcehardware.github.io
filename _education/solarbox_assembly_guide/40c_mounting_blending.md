Optional you can mount handles to carry the box.

### Mount side blending

### Mount to blending with handles.
* Put the SolarBox on the bottom.
* Position squre nuts for the top blending.
* Put top blending.
* Put handles on the top blending.
* Insert **longer** bolts through the handles, the blending and squre nuts. Use normal bolts for other parts of the blending.
* Tighten the blending.

### Mount last side blending
